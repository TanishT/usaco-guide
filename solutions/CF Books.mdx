It is easiest to use the method of two pointers. The left pointer means the beginning of the segment of books to read, the right one - the end. 
When moving the left pointer one unit to the right, the right pointer should be repeatedly moved to the right as long as the sum of all
$a_i$ within the segment is less than or equal to $t$. This way, we can find for each possible left end the rightmost possible right end. 
The answer to the problem is the maximum length over all possible left ends.

## C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n, t;	
	cin >> n >> t;
	int arr[n];
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		cin >> arr[i];
	}
	int left = 0;
	int sum = 0;
	int count = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		sum += arr[i];
		if (sum <= t) {
			count++;
		} else {
			sum -= arr[left];
			left++;
		}
	}
	cout << count << endl;
	return 0;
}
```
